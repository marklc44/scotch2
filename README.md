# ScotchyScotchMe

Want the most expensive Scotch? The highest rated? The oldest? A nice Speyside or a heavy handed Islay?

ScotchyScotchMe is part of a continuing Scotch Whisky flavor search and data visualization project. Explore Scotch by region, producer, flavor profile, age, price and rating.

This version of the project is an Angular SPA built on Rails with Postgres.

### See the live site at [scotchy.herokuapp.com](http://scotchy.herokuapp.com).

-  Deal data from Semantics3.
-  Whisky Ratings and pricing from Whisky Advocate.
-  Graphing Rating/Price/Age relationships with D3js

-  Rspec tests
-  Rake and Nokogiri scraping and data population
-  ui-angular, custom directives, fun filters, factories and resources
-  Some [scraping scripts I wrote for this project are outside the repo here](https://github.com/marklc44/sample_scrapers).
